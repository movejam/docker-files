Here I will upload most of the compose files I have used.
The files are mostly for Synology but also for Raspberry Pi.
I use a Synology DS920+, a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a Raspberry Pi Zero. Some of my Containers are also running on an old MacBook Pro (late 2013). I'm very into home automation and a smart home. Therefore I use Home Assistant on a daily basis. 

Stay tuned for more.
